    <p>
        My topic choice is to make a scanvenger hunt about the seal of Davis. I will be partnering with Subhan Baig. Using the seal, users will be able to see what the seal and its contents are in an interactive manner. We will highlight significant milestones and events. In addition, students will be able to scan QR codes in order to learn more about the monuments.
